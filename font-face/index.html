          Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're
          looking for environment setup instructions, they've moved to
          <a href="line">their own section</a>. Continue reading for an
          introduction to the documentation, Native Components, React, and more!

        <p>
          React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOs
          applications using React and the app platform's native capables. With
          React Native , you use JavaScript to acccess your platform's APIs as
          well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React
          components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more
          about React in the next section. But first, let's cover how components
          work in React Native.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          React Native runs on <a href="line">React</a>, a popular open sourse
          library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most
          of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can
          get you started or can serve as a refresh course.
        </p>
        <p>We're going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>+ components.</strong> The rest of this introduction to React
          uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need
          mames and a cafe to work in.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>+ JSX.</strong> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that
          lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so :<span
            class="item-color"
            >&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;Text&gt;</span
          >. The React docs have
          <a href="line">a comprehensive guide to JSX</a> you can refer to learn
          even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it.
          Here you are declaring a name for the cat, name, and embedding it with
          curly braces inside<span class="item-color"> &lt;Text&gt;</span>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>+props.</strong> Props is short for "properties".</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>+ state.</strong> While you can think of props as arguments
          you use to configure how components render, state is like a
          component's personal data storage. State is useful for handling data
          that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State
          gives your components memory!
        </p>
        <br />
      </div>
      <div>
        <div class="maintext"><sup>4</sup> Handling text input</div>
        <br />
        <p>
          Textinput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It
          has an onChange Text prop that takes a function to be called every
          time the text changed, and an onSubmitEdition prop that takes a
          function to be called when the text is submitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
          their words into a different language.In this new language, every
          single words is written the same way :üçï. So the sentense "Hello there
          Bob' would be translate as "üçï üçï ".
